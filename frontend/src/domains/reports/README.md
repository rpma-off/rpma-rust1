# Reports Domain

Frontend bounded context for report pages, export workflows, and report-specific components.

## Public Surface
- `api/`: provider, report hooks, components, and typed report contracts.
- `components/`: report tabs, content, filters, and exports.
- `server/`: route-layer reporting facade exports.
