﻿Analyze my existing codebase and generate the following complete documentation in Markdown format. Use the source code, file structure, dependencies, and patterns used to create accurate and detailed documentation.
## Documents to create:

### 1. README.md
- Project overview based on code analysis
- Identified technical stack (frameworks, libraries, database)
- Detected architecture (monolith, microservices, etc.)
- Setup instructions derived from config files
- Available scripts (package.json, Makefile, etc.)

### 2. REQUIREMENTS.md
- Existing features identified in the code
- User stories deduced from controllers/routes/components
- Data models analyzed
- Third-party integrations detected (APIs, services)
- Technical constraints observed
### 3. API.md
- Endpoints extracted from the code (routes, controllers)
- HTTP methods used
- Authentication middleware detected
- Validation schemas found
- Response format based on models

### 4. DATABASE.md
- Database schema based on models/migrations
- Relationships between identified entities
- Indexes and constraints detected
- Existing migrations analyzed

### 5. ARCHITECTURE.md
- Documented folder structure
- Architectural patterns identified (MVC, Clean Architecture, etc.)
- Application layers detected
- Data flows observed in the code
- Dependencies between modules

### 6. DEPLOYMENT.md
- Existing deployment configuration (Docker, CI/CD)
- Environment variables used
- Build/deployment scripts found
- External services configured

### 7. DESIGN.md (if applicable)
- Identified UI components
- Styles/CSS/themes used
- Template/view structure
- Assets and graphic resources

### 8. USER-FLOWS.md
- User journeys deduced from routes/pages
- Identified interface states
- Error handling implemented
- Observed business workflows
## Specific instructions:
- Be precise and factual, basing your comments solely on what exists in the code
- Use concrete examples taken from the source code
- Identify any gaps or inconsistencies
- Suggest improvements where relevant
- Format correctly in Markdown with clear sections
- Include ASCII art diagrams where necessary

Start by analyzing the entire structure of the project, then generate each document in detail.
